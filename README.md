# Zombie Survival 3D (Python + PyOpenGL)

A 3D zombie survival game built using **Python**, **PyOpenGL**, and **Pygame**. Control a player in a 3D environment, shoot incoming zombies, and survive as long as possible. Includes collision detection, basic AI, and real-time rendering.

## Features

- **3D Environment** powered by PyOpenGL
- **First-person player movement** with collision detection
- **Shooting mechanics** (bullets destroy zombies)
- **Zombie AI** that moves toward the player
- **Pillars as obstacles** that block movement for players, bullets, and zombies
- Modular structure for **easy feature extension**
- Real-time rendering and updates
